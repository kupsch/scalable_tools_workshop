CSCADS Workshop on Petascale Tools)
will be held {{site.data[page.year].dates.startdate | date: "%A, %B %-d"}} through {{site.data[page.year].dates.startdate | date: "%s" | plus: workshop_len |  date: "%A, %B %-d"}} this year at the Granlibakken Resort in Lake Tahoe, California.
As in previous years, we will begin with presentations of people's work,

for the second half of the workshop.

On Sunday evening, the welcome reception starts at 5:30pm and dinner at 6:30pm.
